## Functional Programming Projects

This repository represents three optional assignments done during the course "Functional Programming" (EDAN40) with Professor
Jacek Malec, at Lund University (LTH).
Hence, these assignments turned into projects for me, and I pushed the boundaries of my knowledge in Functional Programming with
the following tasks in Haskell :

  1. _Chatterbots_ : implement a Chatterbot module based on "Eliza" ( One of the most famous programs in the history of artificial intelligence is Joseph Weizenbaum's program Eliza)
  2. _String alignment_ : solve a fundamental theoretical problem from combinatorics using memoization. An efficient approach that has a great importance for solving combinatorial problems related to modern molecular biology.
  3. _Functional Parsing_ : create a parser and an interpreter for a small imperative language. The main goal is to get acquainted with a monadic way of solving a classical problem in computer science.

Please contact me if you have any further questions.
Thank you in advance for your time !
